# Simple Weather App with React

## Project Description

*I created this project as a final work of the **SheCodes** React workshop. This project is a **weather forecast web application** which can be accessed through any web browser to see current weather and a five-day forecast. It provides temperatures and weather conditions.*

### 1. Key features

- The **single-site** web app is built with **React**, HTML and CSS; and it uses a free weather **API**
- The layout of the page uses **bootstrap**
- The UI design was created with **accessibility** in mind
- The website is **responsible** and can be viewed in a web browser or on a mobile device
- **Animated weather icons** show the current weather conditions
- Current temperature can be displayed in **Celsius or Fahrenheit**
- At the bottom of the page, you can see a **new quote** about mindfulness every time you visit the page

### 2. Usage

- You can **access** the application in any browser with an internet connection; no need to install anything
- You can either:
  - **Enter a location** into the search bar to look up data for the city and then click on search
  - Click on the *My location* button and **enable the location** services in the popup of the browser to see data for your current location
- The following data will be shown for the given location:
  - name of the city
